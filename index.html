It is also considered as an education hub of the state and has campuses of both the Indian Institute of Technology and the Indian Institute of Management. Located on the southern edge of Malwa Plateau, at an average altitude of 553 meters (1,814 ft) above sea level, it has the highest elevation among major cities of Central India. The city is 190 km (120 mi) west of the state capital of Bhopal. Indore had a census-estimated 2011 population of 1,994,397 (municipal corporation) and 2,170,295 (urban agglomeration).

             <p>It’s been 20 years since the release of the film that redefined the Indian comedy genre of the twenty-first century – Priyadarshan’s Hera Pheri. This cult comedy was based on another classic, Ramji Rao Speaking, a Malayalam film released in 1989. Over these two decades, Hera Pheri’s become somewhat of a religious piece of film, the kind that Indian cinema folklore would pass on for generations to come — reminding everyone of Priyadarshan’s genre of humourism, Paresh Rawal’s sprightliness, and Akshay Kumar’s ability to suspend vanity.<br>

We’ve moved on to a dry comedy landscape now, where boorishness and crass humour is what everyone is subjected to. So if given a choice to watch any slapstick comedy again, I’d choose Hera Pheri, like any other dogmatic devotee of the film. Here’s why I believe this film has aged like fine wine.</p>
